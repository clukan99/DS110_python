# DS110_python
## This is a revamp on the DS110 course that I took in the fall -- Written in python
This project is currently a data science independent study. I will be completing all of this code with python and using the packages sklearn, pytorch, and tensorflow. 

I am doing this to accomplish a couple things:
1. Help me and my professor understand how to complete machine learning in Python instead of R
2. I would like to learn more advanced techniques other than the packages that exist in sklearn. sklearn is important in the learning of data science, however, this is not used as much in the industry.
3. I will be uploading more demos in pytorch and or tensorflow to enhance my knowledge of more complicated machine learning techniques.

In addition to this 're-vamp' of the course, I will be completing data analysis on a few datasets that are not otherwise **Well known**
